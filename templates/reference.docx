This is a placeholder for a DOCX reference template. In a real implementation, this would be a properly formatted Microsoft Word document that serves as a template for pandoc's DOCX output. The reference document should include:

1. Proper heading styles (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.)
2. Font settings (recommended: Arial or Calibri, 11pt)
3. Margin settings (1 inch on all sides)
4. Line spacing preferences
5. Color scheme for headings
6. Table formatting
7. Bullet point styles

To create a proper reference.docx file:
1. Create a new Word document
2. Format it with your preferred styles
3. Add sample headings, text, tables, and lists
4. Save as reference.docx
5. Place in templates/ directory

This file will be used by pandoc to style all DOCX outputs according to your formatting preferences.
