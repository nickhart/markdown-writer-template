This is a placeholder for a resume-specific DOCX reference template. This should be a Microsoft Word document optimized for resume formatting with:

1. Professional resume font (Arial, Calibri, or similar - 11pt for body, 14-16pt for name)
2. Tight margins (0.5-0.75 inches)
3. Minimal line spacing for content density
4. Bold formatting for headings and company names
5. Clean bullet point styles
6. Consistent spacing between sections
7. Professional color scheme (typically black with optional accent color)

This reference document will ensure all resume DOCX files follow professional formatting standards.
